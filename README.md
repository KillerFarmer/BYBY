The team was tasked to develop a solution for the following user story: 
> Luz wishes to brew a batch of her own duff recipe.
>
> She uses Alejandra's Brew Your Batch Yourself Inc. (BYBY) service to produce her batch. From her home, Luz connects to the BYBY page and captures her recipe. On capture, the recipe properties, restrictions and procedures are stored. 
>
> Next day, Luz gathers her ingredients and opens the BYBY app. Shes selects her recipe, sees a list of BYBY facility locations that comply wit the recipe restrictions and heads to the nearest one. On arrival, she queries her stored recipes and selects one for brewing. On confirmation, a bioreactor is assigned to her and a list of available sensors are displayed. Finally, she selects the ones that she wants to monitor and confirms.
