#Sign In/Up
One of the main aspects of any WebApp that allows users to sign up is the ability to *store* said users, we could have a local database of user information and encrypt that information ourselves, but that seems like a major security hazard and a legal liability if anything goes south. Fortunately, AWS provides a unique service that handles both of these concerns for us: [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/ "Cognito"). Additionaly, this allows us to implement authorization tokens so that only registered users can make us of our site functionality (lambda functions) which we'll discuss later on.
