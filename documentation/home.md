# Home
By default this page will initially be blank, and will only be filled after the user has made one of the following:
* [A batch](https://github.com/KillerFarmer/BYBY/tree/documentation/documentation/batch.md "Make a batch")
* [A recipe](https://github.com/KillerFarmer/BYBY/tree/documentation/documentation/recipe.md "Register a recipe")

![home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KillerFarmer/BYBY/documentation/documentation/img/homeblank.png "home")

Once the user has created either a recipe or a batch, the home page will show them in a list style.
